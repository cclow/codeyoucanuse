### Build Kick-Ass Applications Using Angular

I teach an Angular development course to help you and your team do just that.

>"The Angular 2 course was clear and concise, the developers were able to 
 quickly ramp up on their Angular JS development. There is a balance 
 between the basics and more advanced topics like automated testing."
