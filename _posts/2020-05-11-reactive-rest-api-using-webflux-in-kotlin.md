Part 1 of Implementing and Testing Reactive REST API using Spring Webflux in Kotlin

Spring Webflux was introduced in Spring Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2 for implementing REST APIs using reactive streams. Reactive programming enables non-blocking, event driven execution which is potentially more scalable and has better throughput.

In this screencast, we demonstrate the implementation and testing of REST API using Spring Webflux, in the Kotlin programming language.
