My first computer was the Apple II Plus in 1981, and I've been programming ever since.
In these more than three decades, I've worked with many programming languages[^1], worked in, led,
and managed development teams and companies.

Coding is still a passion for me.
This is where I talk about coding.

[^1]: BASIC, 6502 and 8088 assembly codes, COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, C, C++, Prolog, Lisp in its various forms, Java, Ruby, Python, R, Javascript, Swift, and a few others
