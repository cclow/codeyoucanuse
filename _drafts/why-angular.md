title: Why Angular Is Complex And Why It's OK
---
The Angular[^naming] framework is often criticised for its steeper learning curve,
especially when compared to other modern web app development libraries and frameworks.
While this is somewhat true,
it is important understand the context of Angular's higher complexity.

### Angular Is A Comprehensive Single-Page Application Framework

The most obvious difference is that Angular is a comprehensive framework
while comparable libraries such as ReactJS and Vue.js are view libraries,
just one building block in the Angular architecture.



To implement a reasonably complete single-page web application, a framework needs building blocks for handling:
* Views: specifically the rendering of displays and management of behaviors in response to interaction events;
* Shared Providers: for management of common states, shared logic, and backend connectivity;
* Client-side Routing: for navigation between "pages", and ensuring that the browser URL is synchronised with the view.

### Angular Blocking Blocks Are Feature Rich

### Angular is Built on Advance But Unfamiliar Technology Stack

### Angular is Mostly Declarative

### Angular Architecture is Optimised for Team Development

[^naming]: In accordance with the [Angular â€” New Naming Guidelines](https://medium.com/@gerard.sans/angular-new-naming-guidelines-eacbebd09363) we will use `Angular` for versions 2 and above, and `AngularJS` for versions 1.x.
