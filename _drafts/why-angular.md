title: Why Angular Is Complex And Why It's OK
---
Complexity is a common complaint about the Angular[^naming] framework,
especially when compared to other comparable modern web app development libraries and frameworks.
While I would not argue that Angular 2+ is less complex than ReactJS or Vue.js, I think it is important
to understand the reasons for this complexity and some mitigation strategies.

### Angular Is A Comprehensive Single-Page Application Framework

To implement a reasonably complete single-page web application, a framework needs building blocks for handling:
* Views: specifically the rendering of displays and management of behaviors in response to interaction events;
* Shared Providers: for management of common states, shared logic, and backend connectivity;
* Client-side Routing: for navigation between "pages", and ensuring that the browser URL is synchronised with the view.

### Angular Blocking Blocks Are Feature Rich

### Angular is Built on Advance But Unfamiliar Technology Stack

### Angular is Mostly Declarative

### Angular Architecture is Optimised for Team Development

[^naming]: In accordance with the [Angular â€” New Naming Guidelines](https://medium.com/@gerard.sans/angular-new-naming-guidelines-eacbebd09363) we will use `Angular` for versions 2 and above, and `AngularJS` for versions 1.x.
